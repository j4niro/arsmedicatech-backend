# ArsMedicaTech Backend

For significantly more details, view the [README for our central repository](https://github.com/ArsMedicaTech/arsmedicatech).

## Brief Overview

This repository is our central Python Flask backend which coordinates with various other backend services, such as the [MCP layer](https://github.com/ArsMedicaTech/arsmedicatech-mcp).

There is also the [Nanoservices repo](https://github.com/ArsMedicaTech/arsmedicatech-nanoservices) for various shared classes and functions that are used by both this repo and the MCP layer, and in the future, perhaps others.

There is also a rich ecosystem of microservices about which more can be gleaned from reading the [README for our central repository](https://github.com/ArsMedicaTech/arsmedicatech) or by perusing the other repositories in this organization.
